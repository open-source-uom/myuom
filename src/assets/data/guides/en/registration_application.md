# Registration application for successful candidates

You will receive it from the [Registration Application in Tertiary Education](https://eregister.it.minedu.gov.gr/).

Enter the 8-digit candidate exam code as your username and as your password, the same one you used to log in the application of the Michanografiko.

During the Registration process, you must declare your contact information, your mobile phone number and your email address, which are confirmed through the relevant mechanisms of the application.

It should be noted that the correctness of the contact details is highly important, as the Secretariats of the Departments will be able to use them in further procedures.
