# Healthcare

As a student, you are entitled to health care. You can find more information [here](https://www.uom.gr/student-care/ygeionomikh-perithalpsh).

> The uninsured students are treated as uninsured citizens.

The undergraduate, postgraduate students and PhD candidates that are not insured by other means are entitled to complete healthcare in the National Healthcare Service (E.S.Y.) with the expense coverage from the National Organization for Healthcare Provision (E.O.P.Y.Y.) according to law 4368/2016 (Α΄ 147) article 31 paragraph 3.

The University of Macedonia, beginning from 1/9/2017, stops providing healthcare to uninsured students, and thus stops issuing and renewing Health Booklets.

The uninsured students, with their SSN, can address to Public Health Centers (K.Y.) according to par. 1 of the article 33 of the law 4368/2016 (Α΄ 21).
