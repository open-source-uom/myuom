# Login to the UoM Register page

On the page [www.uom.gr/register](https://www.uom.gr/register) you will use the information:

- **Candidate Code** (you will find it on the card with which you took the exams but also in the registration form of the ministry)
- **Candidate Initials** - the 4 capital letters of your personal details in order:
  1. Surname
  2. Name
  3. Father's Name
  4. Mother's Name
- **SSN**

After you log in, your details will appear.

> **ATTENTION:** In the indication 'Academic Google platform' and specifically in the two fields marked in blue, your University email and the password are displayed. You must write them down (or print the whole page) as you will need them to complete the process and participate in the university's e-services!

Firstly, make sure you have all the required documents available in electronic form.

Then, follow the instructions carefully in order to register.

Check the website of your department. The required documents are usually the following:

1. **Copy of ID** or Passport for foreign students (translated and certified by the public authorities).
2. **Registration application** (from the [Registration Application in Tertiary Education](https://eregister.it.minedu.gov.gr/)) signed by the candidate (you must print it and sign it at the bottom, anywhere you want).
3. **Photo** (file .jpg, with dimensions at least 240x240px). Those of you who do not have one, you can take a photo with your mobile phone. To edit the photo you can use an image editing program such as Photoshop, GIMP or even online on [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/).
4. **Solemn Declaration** of NON-registration in another School or Department of Tertiary Education.

You can find this declaration [here](https://www.uom.gr/site/images/downloads/%CE%A5%CF%80%CE%B5%CF%8D%CE%B8%CF%85%CE%BD%CE%B7%20%CE%94%CE%AE%CE%BB%CF%89%CF%83%CE%B7%20%CE%9C%CE%B7%20%CE%B5%CE%B3%CE%B3%CF%81%CE%B1%CF%86%CE%AE%CF%82%20%CF%83%CE%B5%20%CE%AC%CE%BB%CE%BB%CE%B7%20%CE%A3%CF%87%CE%BF%CE%BB%CE%AE%20%CE%AE%20%CE%A4%CE%BC%CE%AE%CE%BC%CE%B1.pdf), print it and sign it at a Citizen Service Center (KEP). Fill in your department, on the top of the document.

Alternatively, you can do it through [gov.gr](https://www.gov.gr/ipiresies/polites-kai-kathemerinoteta/psephiaka-eggrapha-gov-gr/ekdose-upeuthunes-deloses), as long as you have a bank account or a tax account in Greece. This way you do not need to visit the KEP.

Fill in the text: **_I am not registered in another Department or School of Tertiary Education_**

> **ATTENTION:** Make sure the files you will send are correct before you send them. You cannot correct them afterwards.

In the registration form (if the registrations are online and not in person) you will be asked for:

- **MALE REGISTRY NUMBER** (for male students)
- **MALE REGISTRY LOCATION** (for male students)
- **MUNICIPAL REGISTRY NUMBER** (it is written on the back of your ID, in the field CITIZEN) \*
- **MUNICIPAL REGISTRY LOCATION** (it is written on the back of your ID, in the field CITIZEN) \*

In the number fields, only numbers are accepted. Do not type the **'/'** in between, just the numbers.

You will find all the information on your ID and on your high school diploma.
