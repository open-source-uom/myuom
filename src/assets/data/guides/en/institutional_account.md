# Institutional account

Remember that you have two accounts (one email account & one for your login to e-services of the University).

Both have a common username and a common initial password.

Activate your institutional account [here](https://uregister.uom.gr/).

Select 'Activate account now!', then 'I am a student' and then 'Begin activation'.

> **ATTENTION:** It is recommended for your convenience to choose the same password for the Institutional Account as the one set for the account in the Google Academic platform (G-Suite).

To change the password in the 'UREGISTER service' [here](https://mypassword.uom.gr/).

Remember, if you change the password you will have to use the new password to log in to all e-services, (except for Gmail, which is a separate service and you can manage it from the Gmail environment).
